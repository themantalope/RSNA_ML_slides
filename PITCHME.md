#### Unsupervised and Supervised Learning

| Unsupervised | Supervised |
|:-------------: | :-------------:|
| Aims to "summarize" data  | Aims to "learn" a function between input data and output |
| Methods to reduce dimensionality of data | Methods to train a system for prediction |
| Clustering, Compression, Association Rules | Regression |

#### Unsupervised and Supervised Learning
* **These methods are not exclusive of each other and can compliment each other!**
* Example: reducing gene expression data to summarize the most important gene expression patterns of a dataset (unsupervised), which is then used to estimate survival (supervised).
